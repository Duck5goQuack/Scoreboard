# Scoreboard
# This scoreboard is designed for streaming KL games

# It requires both pygame and python to be installed, and I recommend using VS Code to run it
# Once run it opens a window with the scoreboard on

# It is very customisable...
#   The finished scoreboard is commented, and explains how to edit the code to the settings of your choosing
